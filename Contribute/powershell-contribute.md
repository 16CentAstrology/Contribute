# Contributing to PowerShell documentation

Thank you for your support of PowerShell!

The Contributor's Guide is a collection of articles that explain the tools and processes we use to
create documentation at Microsoft. Some of these guides cover information that is common to any
documentation set published to [docs.microsoft.com][docs]. The PowerShell documentation contains
[guides][psdocs] that are specific to how we write documentation for PowerShell.

The common articles are available in this centralized Contributor's Guide. The PowerShell-specific
guides are available .
