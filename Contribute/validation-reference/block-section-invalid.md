## Warning

`Invalid syntax for alert, div, or video. The text will be rendered as a block quote.`

Several Docs Markdown extensions begin with the string `> [!`. A space is required between `>` and `[`, and there must be a closing `]`. If the syntax is incorrect, the text will be rendered as a block quote.

## Resolution

[!INCLUDE [docs-authoring-pack](includes/docs-authoring-pack.md)]

Ensure the syntax is correct for the extension you're using:

```markdown
