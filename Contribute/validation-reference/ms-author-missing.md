## Warning

`Missing attribute: ms.author. Add the current author's Microsoft alias.`

## Resolution

Add the current author's Microsoft alias for `ms.author`. This should be either the individual author of the article, or a designated team alias.

Note that this should be the *current* owner of the article, not the original author if ownership has changed.
