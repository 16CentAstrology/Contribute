## Suggestion

`Invalid value for manager: '{value}' is not a valid Microsoft alias.`

Some content groups require the `manager` attribute to identify the author's manager.

## Resolution

The value of `manager` must be a valid alias for an individual Microsoft employee. Verify the author's manager's alias and update the value.
