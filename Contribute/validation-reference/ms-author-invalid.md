# ms-author-invalid

[!INCLUDE [suggestion-note](includes/suggestion-note.md)]

## Suggestion

`Invalid value for ms.author: '{value}' is not a valid Microsoft alias, or is not an allowed distribution list.`

## Resolution

Verify that the `ms.author` value is a valid Microsoft alias. If the alias is a distribution list, it must also be on the allow list.

Valid values for DLs can be found on [this Microsoft-internal site](https://docsmetadatatool.azurewebsites.net/allowlists).
