> This rule is initially enabled as a "Suggestion" to give content teams time to gauge impact and develop a plan to clean up their repos. Suggestions don't require immediate action, but you should fix them as soon as possible because at some point they will be elevated to Warnings or Errors. Details about when the severity will change and to what will be included in the message when available.
