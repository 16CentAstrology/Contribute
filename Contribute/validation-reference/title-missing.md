## Suggestion

`Missing attribute: title. Add a title string (19 - 59 characters) to show in search engine results.`

## Resolution

Add a title string to show in search results. In general, titles should be between 19 and 59 characters, not counting a site identifier such as "| Microsoft Docs", and should include relevant branding words, such as Azure. You can preview how your title will look in Google on [https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag](https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag).

If you're a Microsoft employee, see [SEO Basics](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-write-seo-basics?branch=master) in the internal Contributor Guide for more information about good titles and search engine optimization (SEO).
