# local-file-path

## Warning

`Link '{link  path}' points to a local file. Use a relative path instead.`

You've added a link with a path on your local computer.

## Resolution

[!INCLUDE [docs-authoring-pack](includes/docs-authoring-pack.md)]

Use a relative path to a file within the same Docs repo, or a URL-based link.

<!--make sure to add this file to your includes folder and verify the path-->
[!INCLUDE [validation-reference-help](includes/validation-reference-help.md)]
