# manager-missing

[!INCLUDE [suggestion-note](includes/suggestion-note.md)]

## Suggestion

`Missing attribute: manager. Add a valid Microsoft alias for the author's manager.`

Some content groups require the `manager` attribute to identify the author's manager.

## Resolution

Add a valid Microsoft alias for `manager`:

```yml
---
ms.author: mbradley
manager: jemash
---
```
