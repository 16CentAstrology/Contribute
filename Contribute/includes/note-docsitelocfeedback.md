> The email template available at [aka.ms/DocSiteLocFeedback](https://aka.ms/DocSiteLocFeedback) handles localization-related feedback. We do not offer public Github repositories for localized content feedback with the exception of azure-docs, which is open for community contribution for 6 additional languages (Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish). For all other repositories and localizations, use the [email template](https://aka.ms/DocSiteLocFeedback) — which receives your input in any language — to report translation issues or to provide technical feedback.
