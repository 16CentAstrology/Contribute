> [!NOTE]
> Most localized documentation does not offer the ability to edit or provide feedback through GitHub. To provide feedback on localized content, use the email template available at [aka.ms/DocSiteLocFeedback](https://aka.ms/DocSiteLocFeedback). There is one exception for Azure documentation. There are public localized GitHub repositories for azure-docs that are open for community contribution for 6 languages: Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. For all other languages and content sets, use the [email template](https://aka.ms/DocSiteLocFeedback)—which receives your input in any language—to report translation issues or to provide technical feedback.
