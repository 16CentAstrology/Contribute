# Review open pull requests in GitHub

You can read new topics before they're published by checking a GitHub repository's open pull-request (PR) queue. You can see proposed updates or new articles in public repositories only.

This article explains how to contribute to Microsoft Learn by reviewing PRs and adding your comments. Community feedback on proposed updates helps the entire community.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Acceptance of the Microsoft Learn CLA and TOU

## Find a PR

1. In your browser, navigate to the repository in GitHub that you want to review. If you're not sure which repo to look at, find one that interests you in our [list of Microsoft Learn repos](https://github.com/orgs/MicrosoftDocs/repositories).

    If you're browsing documentation and don't know which repo it belongs to, select the **Edit** pencil icon at the top of the page. This action takes you to the source file on GitHub. The repository name is displayed in the upper-left corner of the page. For example, the following image shows the repo name location for the `azure-dev-docs` repo.

1. Choose the **Pull requests** tab to see the open PRs for that repo. If the repo has a lot of PRs, use the **Filters** bar to filter by label, author, and more. Or use the **Search** bar to look for specific queries.

1. Open a PR by selecting the title link.

## Review a PR

1. In the **Files changed** tab, review the changes the submitter proposed. You can add comments or suggest changes by selecting the **+** icon next to the line number. To select multiple lines, drag your mouse over the lines you want to comment on.

    - In the comment box that appears, you can leave comments. You can edit the code directly by selecting the **Add a suggestion** button (which looks like a rectangle with a plus/minus icon). When you select **Add a suggestion**, GitHub adds the line(s) of code you're reviewing to the comment box automatically. In the following example, the reviewer has changed line 33 and comments about it below the `suggestion` area:

    - When you're done adding your comment, select **Add a single comment** to post it. You can also select **Start a review** to add multiple comments and then post them all at once.

1. In the **Conversations** tab, read through the comments. If you have questions or comments, add them to the conversation. You can also add reactions to comments by selecting the smiley face icon in the bottom-left corner of each comment.
