# Collections in Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn Collections is a feature available to anyone with a Microsoft Learn profile. Collections allow you to create curated lists of Microsoft Learn content to share with your followers. A collection can include documentation articles, training modules, learning paths, videos, code samples, and more.

## Use cases

- Bookmark useful content that you need to reference often.
- Bookmark interesting content that you don't have time to read right now and want to revisit later.
- Curate content to share with your employees, students, followers, or community. In this case, plan what content you'll save to the Collection and how you'll organize it before you create it.

## Create a collection

You can create a collection from your profile page or from the content page of any Microsoft Learn item.

### Create a collection from your Microsoft Learn profile

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
1. Navigate to your profile page by selecting your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the page.

1. Select **Collections** from the menu on the left-hand side of the page. If you've created any collections already, you'll see hthem displayed here.
1. Select **+New Collection** to create a new collection.
1. In the pop-up box that appears, give your new collection a title and a description. Select **Create**.

    Your collection now appears in the list of collections on your profile page.

### Create a collection from a Microsoft Learn item

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
1. Navigate to the Microsoft Learn item you want to add to a collection. Look for the **+Add** or **+** button.
    -  For a training module or learning path, the button appears near the bottom of the title section:
        :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-module.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add button on a learning path.":::
    - For an article, the button appears to the right of the title:
        :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-article.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add button on an article.":::
    - For a code sample, the button appears on the **Browse code samples** page, at the bottom of each search result:
        :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-code-samples.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add button on code samples.":::
1. In the pop-up box that appears, select **+New Collection**. Give your new collection a title and a description. Select **Submit**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-from-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create a collection window.":::
1. You'll be returned to the previous pop-up screen, where the collection you just created is now selected. Choose **Save** to add the item you're viewing to the new collection. You can select more collections from the list to add the item to multiple collections.
    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/add-to-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add to a collection window.":::
1. A confirmation message appears at the top of the screen confirming the item has been added to the collection you just created.

## Add an item to a collection


### Plan your collection

- Before building your Collection, be clear about its purpose and what action you want the viewers to take. Prepare the different elements of the Collection ahead of time.
- Use a short, descriptive title that summarizes the topic covered in the Collection.
- Add a description of what’s included in the Collection so that the viewer understands its purpose and what action you’re suggesting they take by accessing the Collection.
- Create sections by topic or type. Use descriptive words to describe the content included in the section. For example:
    - Access Azure Arc Learning Content
    - Find your certification pathway to Azure Virtual Desktop
    - Watch training videos for Azure Virtual Desktop
- Add a short description of the resources included in the section that directs the user to a specific action. For example:
    - Learn how to do more with less on Azure when you migrate to the cloud.
    - Optimize your investment and reinvest for growth.
    - Complete the following Microsoft Learn modules to gain skills and start implementing Azure Virtual Desktop in your company.

## Add items to the collection

- Limit the number of items in the Collection to fewer than 10 items. Three to five items is ideal.
- The first item will get the most engagement, followed by positions two and three.
- The items in positions four through ten will receive more engagement if the sections are used.
- Sort sections and items in the order you recommend the user consume them.

## Limitations

- Collections can include only content on Microsoft Learn. You can't add external links. Only Official Collections created by Microsoft employees can include links to resources outside of Microsoft Learn.
- When you add new content to a collection, it's added to the bottom of the list. You can reorder the content by using the **up** and **down** arrows, one space at a time. Wait until each individual move interaction completes before selecting the **up** or **down** arrows again. We're working to improve this experience.

## Localization

- The title, description, and section titles and descriptions will appear only in the language the creator provides.
- The pieces of content added to the Collection (for example, modules, events, certifications) will appear in the Collection viewer's preferred language if that content has been localized elsewhere on the site already.
