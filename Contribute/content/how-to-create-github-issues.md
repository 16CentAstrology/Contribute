# Create GitHub issues

Our documentation is a continuous work in progress. Good GitHub issues help us focus our efforts on the highest priorities for the community. 

The more detail you can provide, the more helpful the issue. Tell us what information you sought. Tell us the search terms you used. If you can't get started, tell us how you want to start exploring unfamiliar technology.

Many of Microsoft's documentation pages have a **Feedback** section at the bottom of the page where you can choose to leave product feedback (**This product** link) or content feedback (**This page** link) to track issues that are specific to that article. Both of these options require you to log in to GitHub or some other system. To leave anonymous feedback, use the **Feedback** thumbs-up icon that appears in the top-right corner of each article, beneath the title.

Issues start the conversation about what's needed. The content team will respond to these issues with ideas for what we can add and ask for your opinions. When we create a draft, we'll ask you to [review the PR](#review-open-prs).

If you know how to fix an issue, consider making the changes yourself and opening a PR for it.
