**PLEASE READ AND THEN DELETE BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ISSUE**

Welcome to the Microsoft Learn contributor guide feedback form!

Issues submitted here are reviewed by the repo managers of the contributor guide, **not product teams.** Your issue should pertain to the documentation in this [contributor guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute) only. Requests for updates to products or product documentation will be closed.

If you have feedback about a product or product documentation, use one of these outlets instead:

- For Microsoft Learn documentation: Use the **Feedback** link at the top of the article. If there is none, post to our [feedback portal](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/).

- For Microsoft Learn training content: Use the **Feedback** link at the top of a module landing page or the **Feedback** link at the bottom of each module unit.

Thank you!
